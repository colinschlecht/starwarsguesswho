# README - STAR WARS GUESS WHO


STAR WARS: Guess Who is a rendition of the classic board-game by hasbro, with a STAR WARS twist! The instructions to play are simple. The user initiates the game by navigating to the link (index.html for now) and selecting 16 characters. A "Mystery Character" will be chosen from one of the 16 characters. The object of the game is to guess the name of the character, after ruling out the other characters.
